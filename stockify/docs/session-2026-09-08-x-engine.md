# Session Report — X Engine for Stockify (2026-09-08)

## Objective

Wire GetXAPI (Twitter/X data) as Stockify's main signal engine, following
BEAR's usage discipline, aimed at the quantum-scarcity investment thesis
(see `thesis-agi-abundance.md`, `thesis-quantum-builders.md`).

## What was built

| Piece | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Settings | `stockify/settings.py` | `getxapi_key`, `getxapi_backup_key`, watchlist path, per-handle count (3), max handles (8) |
| X adapter | `stockify/adapters/x.py` | Watchlist-driven `advanced_search`, free balance check w/ backup fallback, zero-balance short-circuit, author_id keys, raw JSON preserved, per-call logging |
| Registration | `adapters/__init__.py`, `services/ingestion.py` | `x` in `ADAPTERS`; dispatch auto-routes to `detect_x` |
| Detector | `services/detector.py` | `SCARCITY_MAP` (10 layers → tickers), `SCARCITY_SHOCK` + `X_OBSERVATION` types, quantum domain inference |
| Watchlist | `config/quantum_watchlist.json` | 5 corporate handles (IonQ_Inc, rigetti, dwavesys, QuantinuumQC, GlobalFoundries) |
| Feed seed | `stockify/seed.py` | `quantum-scarcity` feed with thesis prompt |
| Tests | `tests/test_x.py` | 15 tests, no live calls |
| Env docs | `.env.example` | Key names + costs documented |

## Test results (live)

- Balance check: $0.325 primary, backup $0.018 — both keys valid
- Smoke fetch: 2 real IonQ posts, author_id keys, ~$0.003
- Full ingest (`ingest x --limit 10`): 10 fetched → 10 records → 10 signals
- Detection: 1× SCARCITY_SHOCK (RGTI), 9× X_OBSERVATION (quantum/general/agents)
- Suite: 20 passed
- Total session spend: under $0.01 (~$0.335 remaining)

## Learnings

1. BEAR's cached response shapes matched the live API exactly. No adapter rework.
2. Keyword detectors are fragile: "trapped ion fidelity milestone" missed every layer until ion/superconducting terms were added. Expect continuous gardening.
3. Score band 0.568–0.614 is too narrow to rank on. Corroboration (2+ independent handles) and engagement-velocity must enter scoring.
4. Corporate handles are marketing-heavy (4/10 AGM reminders). BEAR's >0.3 signal-density rule should gate watchlist membership. Individual researchers likely outperform brands.
5. Untested live: multi-handle pagination, thread expansion, backup failover against dry primary, user/tweets vs advanced_search tradeoff.

## Open (not built)

- Genius-individual handles + GitHub repo watchlist (needs user-supplied handles; will not invent them)
- Corroboration scoring (same claim across 2+ handles boosts confidence)
- Engagement-velocity in base score (currently static snapshot only)
- `user/tweets` endpoint evaluation vs `advanced_search`
- QRL/CELL/QANX diligence pipeline (GitHub activity, liquidity, audit review per thesis questions)

## Budget ledger

| Action | Calls | ~Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Balance checks (free) | 3 | $0.000 |
| Smoke fetch (1 handle × 2) | 1 | $0.001 |
| Full ingest test (5 handles × 2) | 5 | $0.005 |
| **Total** | | **~$0.006** |

## Git status

Uncommitted, per instruction. Files: `.env.example`, `adapters/__init__.py`, `seed.py`, `services/detector.py`, `services/ingestion.py`, `settings.py` (modified); `config/quantum_watchlist.json`, `docs/thesis-*.md`, `docs/session-2026-09-08-x-engine.md`, `stockify/adapters/x.py`, `tests/test_x.py` (new).
