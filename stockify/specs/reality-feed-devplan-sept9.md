## The State Machine

```
RESEARCH
idea → paper → independent reproduction

IP
patent application → grant → assignment

GOVERNMENT
RFI → solicitation → LOI → award → option exercised

CORPORATE
pipeline → qualification → order → backlog → shipment → revenue → cash

PHYSICAL
planning application → permit → interconnection request → approved → construction → commissioning → production

NUCLEAR
pre-application → application → regulatory questions → approval → fuel allocation → fuel fabrication → operation
```

## Key Discoveries

### PUDL saves months
Catalyst Cooperative cleaned EIA/FERC/EPA data. Use PUDL as warehouse.

### TWSE is absurdly good
Monthly revenue for Taiwanese companies. Detect acceleration before quarterly earnings.

### OpenDART purpose-built
Korean XBRL, capital increases, treasury shares, lawsuits.

### NRC ADAMS just became easier
Public Search API released Dec 2025. 3M+ records.

### Hiring is better than LinkedIn
Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever public endpoints. Semantic change in hiring composition.

### OpenAlex replaces paper scraping
CC0 research graph. $1/day free API.

## Access Traps

| Source | Trap |
|--------|------|
| JPX TDnet | Public viewer free, historical API not free |
| ERCOT | Geographically restricted outside US |
| PatentsView | New API keys suspended; use bulk |
| SBIR | API under maintenance; use bulk |
| OpenAlex | Dataset open, API not infinitely free |
| EPO OPS | Free only to 4GB/week |

## The Discovery Example: LPKF

```
OpenAlex: glass-substrate papers +190%
CORDIS: new European glass-packaging consortium
USPTO/EPO: TGV patent families accelerating
TWSE: glass-equipment suppliers revenue +40%
GitHub: CPO tooling activity accelerates
Intel job boards: glass-substrate process engineers +12
LPKF jobs: field service hiring in Asia
LPKF: production follow-on order
```

No sentiment analysis. Stockify discovers LPKF from the world.
