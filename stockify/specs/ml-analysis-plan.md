## What We Can Do

### Phase 1: Source Ranking (ML)

**Goal:** Which X accounts produce the most alpha?

**Approach:**
- For each account, track: posts, engagement, reply quality
- Measure: did their posts predict stock moves?
- Output: source_reputation table

**ML Method:** Simple scoring + LLM qualitative assessment

### Phase 2: Signal Prediction (ML)

**Goal:** Predict which signals will lead to stock moves

**Approach:**
- Features: signal_type, domain, score, author_reputation, timing
- Labels: did the stock move after the signal?
- Output: signal_quality scores

**ML Method:** Gradient boosting (XGBoost) or simple neural network

### Phase 3: Convergence Detection (ML)

**Goal:** Detect when multiple labs discuss the same topic

**Approach:**
- Embed recent posts
- Cluster by semantic similarity
- Flag when 2+ independent labs discuss same topic

**ML Method:** Embedding similarity + clustering

### Phase 4: Thesis Evolution (LLM)

**Goal:** Track how theses change over time

**Approach:**
- Store rolling textual summary per person × topic
- Feed previous summary + new posts to LLM
- Ask: "Did their belief materially change?"

**ML Method:** LLM reasoning over text

### Phase 5: Portfolio Optimization (ML)

**Goal:** Optimize position sizing based on thesis alignment

**Approach:**
- Features: thesis_score, financials, convexity, probability
- Labels: historical returns
- Output: optimal weights

**ML Method:** Mean-variance optimization + Kelly criterion
