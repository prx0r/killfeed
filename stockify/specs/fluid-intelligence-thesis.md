# The Fluid Intelligence Thesis

**The deeper endgame is continuous co-design of intelligence all the way down to physics.**

## The Current Stack (Rigid)

```
problem → model → framework → compiler → GPU → transistor
```

## The Future Stack (Fluid)

```
problem
→ infer computational structure
→ choose/model an algorithm
→ choose numerical representation
→ choose memory layout
→ choose interconnect
→ choose accelerator/substrate
→ compile specifically for that substrate
→ measure performance
→ redesign the model/hardware
→ repeat
```

The AI asks: "Given this objective, latency budget, power budget, silicon area, manufacturing process, memory bandwidth and acceptable error rate, what computation should exist at all?"

That is **fluid intelligence in hardware**.

## The Optimization Timescale Spectrum

| Timescale | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| milliseconds–seconds | Routing workloads across GPU/TSU/photonic/analog units, dynamic precision, sparsity, cache placement |
| Minutes–hours | Compiler/kernel synthesis, architecture search, generated circuits on reconfigurable hardware |
| Days–weeks | FPGA/CGRA configurations, chiplet/system topology redesign |
| Months | New ASIC generations |
| Years | New semiconductor processes/material systems |

"Near-real-time substrate optimization" means the machine continuously chooses and reconfigures available physical resources, while slower AI design loops continuously manufacture better ones.

## The Cambrian Explosion of Computational Substrates

If AI chip design becomes cheap enough, specialized hardware proliferates:

- **dense-matrix chips** — GPU/TPU-like
- **Transformer ASICs** — Etched-type
- **thermodynamic chips** — Extropic
- **photonic compute**
- **optical interconnect** — Lightmatter-type
- **analog compute**
- **in-memory compute**
- **neuromorphic/event-driven chips**
- **probabilistic accelerators**
- **robotics-specific processors**
- **simulation accelerators**
- **cryptographic/proof accelerators**
- **scientific-computing ASICs**
- **tiny edge inference chips**

And then combinations as **chiplets**.

The AI decides where each piece of the problem belongs.

## Model Architecture Stops Being Sacred

Currently:

> We invent Transformer → hardware companies optimize Transformer.

Eventually:

> AI sees available physics → invents a neural architecture suited to that physics.

That is exactly what makes Extropic interesting. Their Z1T work is an early primitive version of:

**hardware constraints → new neural architecture**

rather than:

**existing neural architecture → force it onto hardware**

## The Closed Loop

$$
\text{AI model}
\rightarrow
\text{hardware design}
\rightarrow
\text{cheaper intelligence}
\rightarrow
\text{better AI}
\rightarrow
\text{better hardware}
\rightarrow \cdots
$$

## The Deepest Formulation: Goal → Physics

Suppose I tell the system:

> Build an autonomous scientific reasoner that maximizes discoveries per joule under a 2 MW power budget.

An advanced co-design system doesn't begin with "Which Nvidia GPU?"

It begins with constraints:

**objective** — discovery rate

**information requirements** — what uncertainty needs reducing?

**algorithm** — search? sampling? deterministic solving? simulation? symbolic reasoning?

**representation** — FP4? integers? probabilities? spikes? analog voltage? photons?

**physical operations** — matrix multiply? stochastic relaxation? optical interference? memory lookup? local message passing?

**hardware** — GPU, ASIC, TSU, photonics, analog, custom chiplet

**materials / manufacturing** — CMOS node, packaging, memory type, cooling, interconnect

You're effectively compiling:

> **goal → physics**

rather than today's:

> **Python → machine code**

## Fluid Intelligence

Intelligence isn't one fixed neural network sitting on one fixed processor.

It becomes a **self-optimizing computational organism**, able to alter:

- its model
- its algorithms
- its precision
- its memory
- its topology
- its compiler
- its hardware allocation
- eventually its hardware design

The primary constraint is no longer our ability to invent architectures manually.

It's increasingly:

> **what does physics permit, and how quickly can we manufacture it?**

## The Cambrian Explosion Hypothesis

If AI chip design, verification and scientific discovery all improve simultaneously, the late 2020s/2030s could look less like a succession of Nvidia generations and more like a **Cambrian explosion of computational substrates**, followed by AI learning which combination of those substrates constitutes the most efficient form of intelligence.
